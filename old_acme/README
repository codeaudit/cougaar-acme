The main steps necessary to use ACME are:

I) Install Cougaar 11.2 (www.cougaar.org)

II) Install the ACME Cougaar overlay

 1) cd <acmedir>/cougaar
 2) ruby install_cougaar_files.rb

III) Install the ACME Service (in one terminal)

 1) cd <acmedir>/acme_service/bin
 2) ruby install.rb  [--help for options...defaults are for single host config]
 3) cd /usr/local/acme
 4) ruby acme.rb

IV) Execute a society (in another terminal)

 1) cd <acmedir>/acme_scripting/examples/ping
 2) ruby run-ping.rb

You should see the output of the society execution (a series of messages streaming
on the console).

For more details of these steps, and to fully understand the ACME architecture see
the ACME_OSS_Framework.doc file.
