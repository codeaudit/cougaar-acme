ACME Service Overview
---------------------

The ACME Service executes within host computers that need to be controlled and tested by and ACME scripts.  
The ACME Service is a plugin-based architecture that is built upon an open-source platform developed by the 
Ruby community named 'FreeBASE'.  The ACME Service is extensible with new capabilities through the creation 
of plugins that conform to the FreeBASE architecture.
  
The plugins that come standard with the ACME Service include  TIC specific, host specific and cougaar 
specific.  The host specific plugins include host stressors (CPU, NIC, power),  host control (reboot, 
rexec, kickstart) and the core communications plugin (acme_host_jabber_service).  The Jabber Service plugin 
provides connection to the Jabber IM server and presents a command/response API through instant messaging.  
The basic message structure that is sent to the JabberService plugin follows this form:

command[name]params 

where name is the name of the command to execute and the (optional) params are parameters passed to the 
command.  The JabberService plugin presents a FreeBASE slot-API for other ACME Service plugins to leverage 
and publish accessible commands.  


ACME Service Installation and Configuration
-------------------------------------------

To begin to use the ACME Service, proceed to download the ACME Service archive (tar.gz for unix systems, 
.zip for window systems).   Uncompressing this file creates the following directory structure:
./acme_service
  ./bin <- Location of installer scripts
  ./regress <- Test scripts
  ./src <- Ruby scripts for the ACME Service
    ./plugins <- ACME Service plugins
      ./acme_... <- Plugin directory
    ./redist <- Redistributed libraries required for running the ACME Service

The ACME Service needs to be installed and running on every host (computer) that will be part of the  
COUGAAR society to be managed through ACME.   To install the ACME Service you are required to have a valid 
installation of Ruby (http://www.ruby-lang.org).  On Win32 system you can download a pre-built version of 
Ruby from (http://rubyinstaller.sourceforge.net) .   To install and build Ruby on Linux systems follow the 
directions laid out at the Ruby language home page.   All of the third-party extensions needed to run the 
ACME Service are contained in the redist directory (under 'src').  The instructions to install the ACME 
Service follow.

Unpack the distribution archive:

Unix-> tar -xvf acme_service.tar.gz
Win32-> unzip acme_service.zip

Move to the bin directory

Unix-> cd acme_service/bin
Win32-> cd acme_service\bin

If you want to obtain installation help,  try the following command:

> ruby install.rb --help
Installs the ACME Service.
Usage:
        install.rb [[-u] [-n] [-t <dir>] [-j <jabberhost>] [-a <account>]
                         [-p <pwd>] [-v <jvm path>] [-l <linux props path>] -h]
        -u --uninstall          Uninstalls the package
        -t --target             Installs the software at an absolute location, EG:
                                install.rb -t /usr/local/acme
                                will put the software directly underneath /usr/local/acme
        -j --jabber-host        The jabber host (default 'acme').
        -a --jabber-account     The jabber account (default <hostname>).
        -p --jabber-password    The jabber password (default <hostname>_password).
        -v --jvm-path           The JVM path to start nodes with.
                                (default '/usr/java/j2sdk1.4.1/bin/java')
        -l --linux-props        The Linux.props path to start the node with.
                                (default '/mnt/shared/acme_config/Linux.props')
        -n --noop               Don't actually do anything; just print out what it
                                would do.

The installation options include the target directory, jabber configuration and jvm/linux properties path.  
The defaults were chosen because of the configuration at the DARPA TIC. To change them just specify your 
desired configuration.

Install the ACME Service

Unix-> sudo ruby install.rb 
password:
Win32-> ruby install.rb
...lots of messages about copying files...

Linux note:  The default directory (if you do not provide on with âtarget)  is /usr/local/acme.  If you 
install in this directory, you will need to do so as root (which is the reason the install command is 
prefaced with sudo).
