0.2.0 - 11-May-2004

- Removed the Win32 module/namespace.  You no longer 'include Win32' and you
  no longer need to prefix Process with 'Win32::'.
- The fork() method is now a global function as well as a method of the
  Process module.  That means you can call 'fork' instead of 'Process.fork'
  if you like.
- Doc updates to reflect the above changes.

0.1.1 - 6-Mar-2004
==================

  fail (Park).

  test directory if desired.
- Fixed up tc_process.rb a bit.
