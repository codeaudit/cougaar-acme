This represents the first release of the ACME Service.  This service must be installed on all
hosts that will run a Cougaar node.  

Linux Requirments:

  Ruby 1.8.1 ( see http://www.ruby-lang.org or http://rubymirror.rubyforge.org )

Windows Requirements:

  Ruby 1.8.1 Installer ( see http://rubyinstaller.rubyforge.org )
  See "WINDOWS NOTES" below.

Installation:

To install this service change to the bin directory and run the install script-

  cd bin
  ruby install.rb --help

To configure the ACME Service to be started on boot on a Linux system, see the bin/README file.

Removing Prior Installations:

Prior to installation, you need to uninstall prior versions (if installed).  The ACME Framework
document contains more detailed installation instructions and should be consulted prior to using
the ACME system.

To uninstall the previous verion of ACME, there used to be a -u action on the bin/install.rb.
This has been removed.  To remove now, simply delete the directory where you -t <target dir>
installed the ACME Service previously.  For example, if you installed the ACME Service in the
default directory on linux:

  /usr/local/acme

Simply enter-

  rm -rf /usr/local/acme

Which will remove the ACME Service.  You also need to remove the working directory (if used)-

  rm -rf ~/.acme

This will ensure that the ACME Service does not use old data when trying to start up.  


WINDOWS NOTES:
Acme process control requires a Ruby extension module located in 
acme_service/src/redist/acme-win32-process/.  See the README file in that dir
for instructions on how to build and install the extension.
