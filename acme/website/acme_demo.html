  	<p>StockTrader is a small application designed to demonstrate the basic features of the ACME distributed testing framework.</p>
  </div>

  <a name="install"/><h2>Installing StockTrader</h2></a>
  <p>First, in order to use this demo, you must first install all of the acme-all rubygem (see <a href="download.html">Download</a> link above).</p>
  <p>Download the acme_demo.zip file from the <a href="http://cougaar.org/frs/?group_id=43">ACME Project files</a>.  Unzip this file into your home directory and it should create a an acme_demo folder.
  Change your directory into that folder and you are ready to run the demo.</p>

  <a name="run"/><h2>Running StockTrader</h2></a>
  <p><b>NOTE:</b> This assumes you are in the acme_demo directory</p>
  <p>First, start the StockTrader ACME service by running the <b>acme-service</b> command:</p>
  <pre>
  [root@tom acme]# acme-service -p service
  $$$$$ USERDIR = /root/.acme
  PLATFORM IS unix

  </pre>
  <p>Next, start the StockTrader example script by running the scripting/stock_trader/run-stock.rb script.  The script will start, connect to the ACME service, and trade some stocks and disconnect.  The output will look something like this:
  <pre>

  <p>Here are some general notes on some of the technical aspects of the StockTrader application.  

  <h3>Generating Action and State documentation</h3>
  <p>Action and State documentation is embedded in the application code so that it's easier to keep up to date.  So, for example, SellStock has a constant field declaration:
  <pre>
    DOCUMENTATION = Cougaar.document {
      @description = "Sells shares of a given stock"
      @parameters = [
        {"Symbol" => "The stock symbol"}, 
        {"Shares" => "The number of shares to sell"}
      ]
      @example = "do_action 'SellStock','IBM',5"
    }
  </pre>
  <p>@description and @example are fairly straightforward.  @parameters is an Array of Hash objects where each Hash defines a single key and value for each parameter and its description.
  <p>To generate the <a href="actions_and_states.html">HTML documentation</a> for the Actions and States, cd into acme-1.6/acme_scripting/bin/ and run html_doc.rb like this:
  <pre>
  ./html_doc.rb > actions_and_states.html
  </pre>
  Note that you can either pass the Action/State names on the command line or you can customize html_doc.rb directly and add something like this at the bottom:
  <pre>
  require 'run-stock.rb'
  puts HEADER
  ["StartTrading", "StopTrading", "SellStock", "BuyStock"].each do |a| 
    puts output_action(Cougaar::Actions[a])
  end
  ["MarketOpen", "MarketClosed"].each { |s| puts output_state(Cougaar::States[s]) }
  puts FOOTER
  </pre>
  There's also a acme_doc.rb if you want plain text output, and of course you can roll your own if you want to integrate it with an IDE.

  <h3>Controlling flow with States</h3>
  <p>The Acme <A href="http://cougaar.org/docman/?group_id=43">manual</a> has a section on how States work, so that's the authoritative source for learning how to use them.  Here are some notes on how StockTrader uses States:
  <ul>
  <li>There are two "NOOP" States - MarketOpen and MarketClosed.  These states don't do anything; they just provide a marker for the Actions to be structured around.  They each serve as a good RESULTANT_STATE; for example, MarketOpen is the RESULTANT_STATE for StartTrading. 
  <li>The SellStock Action has a PRIOR_STATE of MarketOpen, which makes sense, since you can't sell stock until the market it open.  If we try to do a SellStock before the market opens we get an error like this:
  <pre>

          from ./run-stock.rb:160

  </pre>
  </ul>

  <h3>Shipping data around with YAML</h3>
  <p><A href="http://www.yaml.org/">YAML (YAML Ain't Markup Language)</a> is a simple, human readable serialization format.  StockTrader uses it to ship market updates around.  The acme_service end of StockTrader has an Array of OpenStruct instances that have two fields, symbol and price.  This information gets broadcast to all interested listeners as YAML-encoded data, which is created like this:
  <pre>
  status = @stocks.collect {|s|[s.symbol,s.price]}.to_yaml
  @monitors.each {|m|
   message = @comm_service.new_message(m)
   message.subject = "StockMarketUpdate"
   message.body = status
   message.send
  }
  </pre>
  <p>The acme_scripting side then loads and decodes the message like this:
  <pre>
  YAML.load(message.body).each {|x|
   @market << Stock.new(x[0], x[1])
  }
  </pre>
  <p>If you're going to use lots of data, a more efficient encoding would save some bandwidth.  But for small amount, YAML does just fine.</p>
