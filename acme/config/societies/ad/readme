This directory contains a zip of all the generated 1AD configurations. 
This includes and replaces the XML configurations that used to come
in the BBN ulconfigs overlay, in the COUGAAR_INSTALL_PATH/configs/ul
directory.

As before, you may run these configurations by hand, using the XMLNode
scripts - in which case please note the name of the node used in these
files. The preferred mechanism continues to be ACME for running UL 
configurations.
