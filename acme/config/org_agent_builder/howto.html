<a name="overview"><h2>Overview</h2></a>
<p>All societies are now generated from CSV files.  The society generation process
consists of two parts.  The generation of a facet configuration and the generation of a society
(sometimes called plugins) configuration.<br>
For all of the 1AD societies, facet files are easily generated from the CSV files using a simple
script.  For the UA societies however, a special tool: <em>SocietyDesigner</em> is required.
</p>
<a name="facets"><h2>Facet Files</h2></a>
<p>A facets file is a pre-configuration file that contains the basic information about each
agent within that configuration.  The information contained in each agent is used by a set of
<tt>Ruby</tt> rules to determine which plugins should be inserted into the agent.<br>
Facets are broken up into two seperate sections, the 1AD facets and the UA facets, however
both facet files look similar.</p>
<h3>1AD Facets</h3>
<p>A script to generate a single 1AD facet file does not exist.  Currently the base set of
facet files are located in the <tt>1ad</tt> directory in <tt>configs/org_agent_builder</tt>.  The
only reason these configurations would need to be re-generated would be if the CSV files changed.
If that happens, running the script: <tt>make-facet-societies.sh</tt> will re-generate all of the
facet configuration files.</p>
<h3>UA Facets</h3>
<p>To generate the UA facets, you must use the <em>SocietyDesigner</em> tool.  This tool,
located in this module allows the rolling up and un-rolling of the UA agents.  For more information on
using this tool, please consult the tool documentation.</p>
<a name="societies"><h2>Society Files</h2></a>
<p>To run a configuration, you need a society file.  Society files can be found in this module,
<tt>config/societies/[ul|ua]</tt>.  However if you need to generate a new society file, there exists a
single script to assist.  The script <tt>gen-plugins-xml.sh</tt> can be used to generate a single society.<br>
The usage of this script is:
<pre>% gen-plugins-xml.sh [society]</pre> Where society is the partial path and name of the society that you wish to generate.<br>
For example: <br>
<pre>
% gen-plugins-xml.sh 1ad/tiny-1ad
</pre>
Would generate a tiny-1ad society in the current directory using the facets file located in the 1ad/ directory.<br>
The basic 1AD Societies are: <br>
<ul>
<li>tiny-1ad</li>
<li>tiny-1ad-trans</li>
<li>small-1ad</li>
<li>small-1ad-trans</li>
<li>full-1ad</li>
<li>full-1ad-trans</li>
</ul>
If you wish to generate all societies in a zipped file, use the scripts: <br>
<tt>create-ul-dist.sh</tt> or <tt>create-ua-dist.sh</tt>
</p>
