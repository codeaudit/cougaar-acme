This is a basic readme for using the acme_doc.rb and html_doc.rb scripts to generate
output of the internal documentation located in each Action and State class.  These
file use Ruby reflection to gather the documentation and print it to the screen.  To
save the output of one of these scripts, simply redirect the output to a file (see
below).  The text version is suitable for terminal based sessions as a quick reference
mechanism (looking up an Action sytax, etc).  The HTML version is suitable for printing
or graphic display (in a web browser).

Text:

cd acme_scripting/bin
ruby acme_doc.rb <ActionName | StateName>
 # This generates documentation only for the named action or state
ruby acme_doc.rb
 # This generates documentation for ALL actions and states
 
ruby acme_doc.rb > state_action.txt
 # Create text file for use or printing
 
HTML:

cd acme_scripting/bin
ruby html_doc.rb <ActionName | StateName>
 # This generates HTML documentation only for the named action or state
ruby html_doc.rb
 # This generates HTML documentation for ALL actions and states
 
ruby html_doc.rb > state_action.html
 # Create text file for use or printing
