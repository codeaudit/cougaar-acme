Polaris is integrated into ACME through several scripts:
  p-register.rb - This registers CVS resources into Polaris.  It
     takes the following parameters:
        -f or --file - File name to register.
        -n or --name - English readable name.
        -c or --config - Use this if registering a Config file.  Leave it off
             if it is a script file.

  p-run.rb - This allows you to run scripts from outside of the Polaris
     server.  It will post the results to the server provided in the
     "p-config.rb" file.  It takes two arguments:
        ARG[0] - This is the ACME script to run
        ARG[1] - This is the configuration file to setup

  p-runner.rb - This script will work with Polaris, and run tasks from
     the apropriate task queue.  See notes about ssh below.
     It takes 1 parameter:
	ARG[0] - This is the type of queue it can service.
                 (0 - SMALL, 1 - FULL, 2 - JUMBO)

SSH -

For p-runner.rb to work, you need to create a ~/.ssh/config file under
the user which will be running the program.  This file needs the following
lines:
   Protocol 1
   BatchMode yes

In addition, you need to take append the identity.pub key to the 
authorized_keys file in Polaris's home on cvs.ultralog.net.
