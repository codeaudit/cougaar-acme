    <div class="description">
    This service presents the report results for UltraLog experiments that execute
    within the UltraLog TIC lab.  To use this service, select a society (below) and
    you will be presented with the list of experiments (ordered by date) for that
    society as well as the summary of the reports that were executed against the
    archived data of that experiment.  Selecting a specific experiment will present
    a detail page which lists all reports, their descriptions, and the files the 
    reports generated.  To return to this main page at any time, select the banner
    graphic (above).
