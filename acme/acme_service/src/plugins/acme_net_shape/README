For the 2004 Objective Prototype, we will be restricting
C-Links and K-Links.  This plugin is designed to enable
us to do just that.

The plugin provides 5 functions:
   shape( interface, kbps ) - Shape the provided interface
      (eth0, eth0.1, etc.) to the specified speed.

   unshape( interface ) - Remove the shaping on the network
      interface.

   enable( interface ) - Enable the network interface.

   disable( interface ) - Disable the network interface.

   reset( interface ) - Put the interface in a known state by
      enabling and unshaping it.

Much of the network configuration logic has been moved to
the Operator machine.  This service takes the Linux device
names as arguments.  The operator is expected to keep track
of what is a C-Link, K-Link and UTB interfaces, and where
they go.

NOTE:  The following files are remanants from 2003 and should
not be used.  They are maintained here for reference while
development is ongoing, but should be moved to the apropriate
location when development is finished:
    vlan-startup
    vlan.rb
    network.xml

The following files have been updated to 2004:
    plugin.rb
    plugin.yaml
    properties.yaml
